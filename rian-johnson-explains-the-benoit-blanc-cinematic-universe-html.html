For one thing, there’s the setting; director Rian Johnson has swapped out the foggy New England locale for the sunshine sizzle of a private Greek island. The cast, save for Daniel Craig’s gentleman sleuth, has been rotated out as well. Gone are Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Chris Evans’s sweater; replacing them is a new array of faces that includes Kate Hudson, Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe, and all 15 of Dave Bautista’s pectoral muscles.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskuma5000q3b6w0h4tac0v@published data-word-count=105>For the most part, though, the beating heart of Knives Out remains pretty much the same in Glass Onion, which, by the way, <a href=#>our film critic Alison Wilmore considers</a> “bigger and better than the original.” The new film carries over its predecessor’s sense of fun and its structural playfulness, along with a deep, sincere love for Agatha Christie and the broader murder-mystery genre. Those things were very much present in Johnson himself when he sat down to talk with us at Vulture Festival, where he discussed, among other things, his feelings for Angela Lansbury. Watch the full conversation below, or read on for the transcript.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskvynp001z3b6wvqgcm1kh@published data-word-count=24><strong>So we’re here to talk about Glass Onion, the sequel to — would you consider it a sequel?</strong><br>I don’t think it’s a sequel, no.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7e000293b6w7gdjpejb@published data-word-count=69><strong>Second part?

It is a meme machine. I believe I saw two Chris Evans sweaters this past Halloween. Were you surprised by the strong response to the first movie?</strong><br>I was coming off of <a href=#>the Star Wars movie</a>, which was obviously the biggest thing I’ll ever do in my life, when I sat down and wrote this murder mystery. The genre was something that — there were good examples of it being done, but it wasn’t something that was really at the forefront. It had been lying there for a bit and getting a little dusty. Even friends of mine who really enjoyed the script when I showed it to them were like, “Are you sure you want to do a murder mystery?” There was the idea that I could take a bigger swing. But I just loved this genre so much, having grown up sitting around the TV with my family and watching Death on the Nile with Peter Ustinov and just feeling like that’s the most fun a movie can possibly be. You have an all-star cast, and every single new face that pops up is like you’re leaning forward. I just thought, This is something that I know I’ll enjoy, but I have no idea whether audiences still want it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasmqtlp00a53b6wwe5sj16x@published data-word-count=8>All to say it was a big surprise.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ec002e3b6w2ihc2fxq@published data-word-count=80><strong>It’s funny to hear the assumption that it’s a smaller step — that you’re moving from Star Wars, which is huge, into something smaller, when the murder mystery is broad, it’s elaborate, it’s lavish.</strong><br>It’s a crowd-pleaser. That’s the thing I remember, for instance, from Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile, this kind of late-’70s, early-’80s phenomenon of the all-star cast — the big, glamorous Hollywood production of a murder-mystery whodunit. It hits all the pleasure buttons.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ec002f3b6wv0ewte52@published data-word-count=29>There was the additional thing with Knives Out, which was setting it in modern-day America.

That could be really interesting. I’m a huge Agatha Christie fan. I love Kenneth Branagh’s Poirot. I think he’s hilarious. I’m a junkie. I just watched <a href=#>See How They Run</a>.

It’s an ensemble, and each one of the characters kind of represents a different little slice of this microcosm of society. There’s a power structure inherent with the suspects and then there’s somebody at the top who everybody has a motive to kill. But Christie’s work is so enveloped in this fog of nostalgia at this point. We’ve spent years watching these adaptations, which are excellent and good and super-fun and I love them — but they’re set in the hazy past. Christie wasn’t doing that; she was writing to her culture. Her very first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, when we meet Hastings, he’s home from the Western Front with an injury. That’s why he’s at this country house. She wrote it in 1916. It’s not like she was an incredibly political writer, but she was always engaging with what was happening at that moment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ed002i3b6w3m8g3ki1@published data-word-count=82>The fact that this genre that’s uniquely suited to do that had not been doing that for a long while got me very excited. What if we just unabashedly said, “Yeah, Knives Out is set in America right now, and I’m not going to worry about making it timeless. I’m just gonna talk literally about whatever we’re talking about in the moment.” It’s a way to engage with stuff that’s happening right now in this comforting, candy coating of a murder mystery.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasnx15y00ct3b6wwu0kuhus@published data-word-count=45>That’s the other aspect of it: I love that candy coating.

You can see why that was appealing in the ’30s. You can see why that is appealing right now.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ed002l3b6wj360d32d@published data-word-count=10><strong>Given the state of 2022, is what you’re saying.</strong><br>For instance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ed002m3b6weieugbr6@published data-word-count=29><strong>You’ve spoken about how murder mysteries are somewhat inherently about class.

There were a lot of things that went into choosing the setting, but a big part of it was wanting, in that moment, to be on a beach somewhere on a Greek island. The first movie was also very much in the tradition of the English-countryside cozy-house murder but in New England. So I wanted to plant a really solid flag at the beginning that this was going to be something completely different than the first one. I wanted to say right up front with Glass Onion, This is going to be the way these movies are — that every single one is totally different.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ee002s3b6wlkrf6w6i@published data-word-count=93><strong>A hard cut between the gloomy, foggy environs to a beautiful, sunny island.</strong><br>But also there’s a rich tradition of destination murders.

And it isn’t Christie but The Last of Sheila. If anyone here doesn’t know Last of Sheila, I bang the drum for this woman continuously because more and more people are discovering it but it’s still underseen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasl3ypd004i3b6wgbdpyeuy@published data-word-count=116>This is a murder mystery from the ’70s that was co-written by Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins. It’s the most ’70s cast of all time. It’s Richard Benjamin as the lead, which automatically pegs it to a window of like four years when Richard Benjamin was a lead in movies. You can see we take a huge page from them for the setup. It’s basically James Coburn as this asshole Hollywood producer who invites all of his friends to a murder-mystery game on his yacht. It’s got Dyan Cannon — and Kate Hudson’s character in Glass Onion owes quite a bit to Dyan Cannon — Raquel Welch, James Mason, and Ian McShane. It’s an incredible cast.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ef002v3b6w4b89meyo@published data-word-count=105><strong>What lessons did you take away from making the first Knives Out movie into making the second?&nbsp;</strong><br>Going into the first one, I was very nervous because we were getting an ensemble of actors together, all of whom could carry their own movie.

The pleasant surprise from the first one is the exact opposite was true.

When we’re on the press tour, there’s a lot of inevitable questions about Daniel with his James Bond role and whether, when I’m writing, I’m actively subverting or working against that. I guess the answer is always — for me at least — no.

On every movie I’ve done, I start working very structurally, and for me, the first 80, sometimes 90, percent of the process is working on my outline in little notebooks. The outline isn’t just the plot — it’s the story, which takes into account the themes and the characters and sketches for scenes. It’s a lot of things.

I need to know the whole road map before I start writing. Not every writer does that. I’ve heard famously that the Coen brothers don’t.

Has he changed as a character?</strong><br>No. I mean, that’s one interesting thing, especially when you have an actor and a movie star, which are two different things, in a lead part who’s as magnetic as Daniel. I think it can be kind of a trap to start thinking that the detective is your protagonist. That’s actually a mistake. The detective is always at the center of it, but he’s also outside of the realm of the human drama.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ei00333b6wodfmk81w@published data-word-count=127>Ultimately, I think that’s why the first Death on the Nile is a high-water mark in terms of adaptations of murder mysteries, with the love triangle and Mia Farrow’s character and the jilted woman who comes back for revenge. It’s got such a great juicy hook to get you into it, and that’s ultimately what you want to reach for. That can’t be the detective. The detective has to be godlike and sort of outside that realm, which is all to say that the detective always kind of operates according to the needs of the mystery. He is different in Glass Onion than he is in Knives Out, but that’s because he’s intentionally trying to play another part in drawing these people out and solving the crime.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ei00343b6wdozxcfle@published data-word-count=119><strong>We asked you to bring us a scene from another murder mystery to break down, and you brought 1978’s Death on the Nile.</strong> <strong>Why did you pick this scene? What does it illustrate for you about the heights of the Agatha Christie–esque murder mystery?</strong><br>Two words: Angela Lansbury. I mean, my God! She’s just incredible, and she’s having so much fun in this part. She is just a joy to watch. She and David Niven — there’s a great moment where Poirot kind of preemptively excuses himself and takes another woman to the dance, and there’s just a moment of David Niven in sheer terror on his face when he realizes what’s about to happen before she sweeps him up.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasli06l006s3b6wbotqbyrd@published data-word-count=117>And Mia Farrow gives a tremendous performance in this movie; she’s so good.

Look at the tuxedo she’s wearing! Look at Bette Davis! Oh my God, it’s incredible. It’s astounding. You can also see the gears working. I love that first half-hour of a murder mystery where you’re trying to do the math in your head of who’s going to get killed and why and trying to outthink it. You can see all of that in play here.

Specifically in Death on the Nile. I do love him in Evil Under the Sun, but it’s a little bit more of an indulgent love. He’s a little bit broader in that movie, a little goofier. I think in Death on the Nile, he struck the perfect balance. To me, when I read Christie, I find Poirot hilarious. That’s the reason that I love Ustinov’s take on the character. Although Albert Finney is doing something absolutely crazy unto himself, and David Suchet has a sharpness to him and kind of an eagle-eye danger to him, I love the slight clownishness of Ustinov and how that keys into the kind of pompous self-inflation of the character.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ek00363b6wt7tuvag4@published data-word-count=44><strong>He quotes philosophers, he makes prognostications, he steals food from other people’s cabins.</strong><br>He’s an incredibly funny character.

Places of luxury, places of spectacle?</strong><br>Not at all. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd takes place in a small town. Death on the Nile is one very specific flavor of what she did: the glamorous getaway mystery.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ek00383b6w1owd9mhx@published data-word-count=163>That’s the other thing about Christie, and that’s the other thing that makes me excited about the notion of making more of these. I think there’s kind of a tendency to think that Christie repeated herself, that her works all fall under a vague grouping of a country house and a body in a library. Basically, you picture the cover of a Clue board, and anyone who’s a true Christie fan knows the exact opposite is the case. She was not just changing it up in terms of where her mysteries were set and not even just in terms of the plot twists of how she did the murders. She was twisting and working and melding genres. Think about Endless Night, which is basically a gothic romance. You think about A.B.C. Murders, which is a serial-killer thriller. You think about And Then There Were None, which is a slasher movie basically. She was essentially finding ways to surprise herself and surprise the audience.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ek00393b6wzpfnynlq@published data-word-count=92><strong>I’m fascinated by the Columbo-type detective versus the Benoit Blanc–type detective. In your mind, how do you articulate the differences between the two?</strong><br>Well, the big difference is a genre one: the howdunit versus the whodunit. In Columbo, the first act is always the crime itself. It’s showing the killer, showing who did it and how, but holding out one little bit of information. Then Columbo enters, and it’s about seeing him unravel that and figuring out how he’s going to do it. Intuitively, you would think that’s not interesting, but it’s riveting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ek003a3b6wesl2fpc1@published data-word-count=168>And that’s actually the way we structure Poker Face, my first TV show, with Natasha Lyonne.<strong> </strong>It’s a weekly episodic TV show. It’s not a serialized thing where it’s one story over an entire season. You get a single story per episode, and it’s Natasha Lyonne basically as a Magnum, P.I. or Rockford Files or Columbo or Murder, She Wrote. She’s the central character, and you’re going to get a whole new cast every single episode. Some of the best storytelling we’ve seen in the past however many years has been this longform serialized TV. But I feel like we’ve hit a point where streamers have come to think that that is the only form of storytelling that gets people to keep hitting “Play next.” There’s a real thirst to get back to “I can just drop in for one episode of this and get a full story, and it’s not a ten-episode commitment to figure out whodunit.” I felt that pull of getting back to self-contained stories.</p><span class="quote has-quote-marks">I think the authors of Ellery Queen famously said, ‘Yes, we play fair with the audience if the audience is the most genius person who ever lived.’</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7el003b3b6w1lcy39dd@published data-word-count=171>So with Poker Face, it’s a howdunit versus a whodunit mystery like Knives Out and Glass Onion where you come in through the perspective of the detective. You only have as much information as them, and the object is to figure out who did it by the end. Although it isn’t, really! Being a big fan of the genre, I can say that it’s a complete lie that the pleasure of a whodunit is presenting a puzzle to the audience that they could potentially solve. I think the authors of <a href=#>Ellery Queen</a> famously said, “Yes, we play fair with the audience if the audience is the most genius person who ever lived.” The reality is the pleasure of the story is the same pleasure as any story, which is, What’s making you lean forward? What character are you worried about? What are the dramatic stakes? As opposed to making you lean back and stroke your chin. A roller coaster as opposed to a crossword puzzle is what I like to say.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasnn9vs00br3b6w0vwksjq8@published data-word-count=31>I also love endings.

So I have a deep emotional attachment to all the genres that you mentioned, not just in an intellectual way but in a way of this is the stuff that fed my childhood. But in an intellectual way, they give you a chessboard. They give you and the audience a shared, defined chessboard. And playing with genres right now when audiences are so savvy, it’s even more exciting because I feel like all of us know so well at this point the tropes and the way these things work. To me, the benefit of that is it creates an underground dialogue throughout the course of the story, where you’re playing with that and against that. That, to me, is a fun meta-conversation to have.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7en003e3b6whh8hiovk@published data-word-count=161><strong>When I think about genres — as in people’s relationships to genres, how they follow them, bend them, break them — I think about rules. Are you a big rules person?</strong><br>I don’t know. Every time I’ve sat down to write any of these things, like a murder mystery or a Star Wars movie or anything, it’s always trying to get back to the essential pure pleasure. Remember in Tron when they find the glowing river and drink it? It’s like, “Oh, here’s the source.” It’s trying to find that with a genre which has had a lot of iterations and a lot of veneer put on it over many, many years. Like with <a href=#>Brick</a>, my first film, it all came from me reading Dashiell Hammett and feeling like I knew and loved film noir. But reading Dashiell Hammett’s books felt like being punched in the stomach. It was trying to get to that kind of feeling that those books gave me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7en003f3b6w773mynza@published data-word-count=112>Or with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, it was trying to get back to the actual feeling of being a kid and seeing The Empire Strikes Back. Not the memory of it as an adult but the actual feeling as a kid. It was fucking terrifying. It was feeling like anything was at play and the good guys were losing. It was scary in the way that fairy tales should be scary because they represent a child’s perspective on these massive life changes that you don’t understand but are trying to. Anyway, that’s a lengthy answer to, yes, I love rules, but I love them to get to much more base pleasures.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7eo003g3b6wapoi1lnf@published data-word-count=27><strong>Is there a genre that you haven’t tackled that you’d really like to?</strong><br>Musical.

I can take my shirt off.” I was like, “Eh, I don’t think so.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7eo003l3b6wu4tlst93@published data-word-count=90><strong>I’ll leave it a surprise for people to see whether he does. In Knives Out, Benoit is famous. A lot of the characters are aware of his fame because of a New Yorker profile, the byline of which is Leopold Chequer. Where did that come from?</strong><br>So because I’m friends with Alex Ross, who’s the music critic at The New Yorker, I wanted to credit him. But The New Yorker has a rule that you can’t. So it would have been Alex Ross. I thought that would have been very funny.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claskw7ep003n3b6w1b8qide9@published data-word-count=50><strong>Lastly: Fuck, marry, kill famous fictional detectives.</strong><br>Oh God. I guess I would marry Miss Marple because that seems like it’d be a nice country life, just living with Miss Marple. Or Jessica Fletcher. Or maybe I should fuck Jessica Fletcher? I have a feeling she’s secretly freaky. Or Sherlock Holmes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasmob49009q3b6wrrdkn3sz@published data-word-count=102>And then kill — who would I kill? I don’t know if I actually want to kill this person, but it’s a great opportunity to pitch John Dickson Carr. He was an American, but he spent a lot of time in England and he was writing in the golden age of the detective-fiction era in the ’30s. He has a detective named Gideon Fell, who’s currently my favorite whodunit detective. He’s modeled on G.K. Chesterton. He’s this big, huge, massive man who walks on two canes and is kind of a total asshole and is just hilarious. So sure, I’ll kill him.</p><h2>More From This Series</h2><ul class=package-list-items><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clbbzsnh80000lbbpwgxg9043@published data-track-headline="‘Auntie Will Never Retire’" data-track-index=0 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>‘Auntie Will Never Retire’</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clb5fk8ba000052d6k9yxee5y@published data-track-headline="Gangs of London Won’t Hold Anything Back" data-track-index=1 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Gangs of London Won’t Hold Anything Back</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clb5cvo5x00002cbfrzi5tbs9@published data-track-headline="Matt Rogers Only Made a Holiday Special for the Money" data-track-index=2 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Matt Rogers Only Made a Holiday Special for the Money</span></a></li></ul><a class=see-all-link href=# aria-label="See All from More From This Series"><span class=see-all-link-text>See All</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Rian Johnson Breaks Open the Benoit Blanc Cinematic Universe</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dhZnyztcCnZKOnmKPAsLqMnq%2BppJGeu7R506GcZpqVo7yqwIybo5qmk2KwqrrEppitoZNiwq%2B11Z6prJ1encGuuA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2frian-johnson-explains-the-benoit-blanc-cinematic-universe-html.html&title=Rian%20Johnson%20Breaks%20Open%20the%20Benoit%20Blanc%20Cinematic%20Universe" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frian-johnson-explains-the-benoit-blanc-cinematic-universe-html.html&description=Rian%20Johnson%20Breaks%20Open%20the%20Benoit%20Blanc%20Cinematic%20Universe" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frian-johnson-explains-the-benoit-blanc-cinematic-universe-html.html&title=Rian%20Johnson%20Breaks%20Open%20the%20Benoit%20Blanc%20Cinematic%20Universe" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2frian-johnson-explains-the-benoit-blanc-cinematic-universe-html.html&title=Rian%20Johnson%20Breaks%20Open%20the%20Benoit%20Blanc%20Cinematic%20Universe" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2frian-johnson-explains-the-benoit-blanc-cinematic-universe-html.html&text=Rian%20Johnson%20Breaks%20Open%20the%20Benoit%20Blanc%20Cinematic%20Universe" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2frian-johnson-explains-the-benoit-blanc-cinematic-universe-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Martina Birk</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-01</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./who-is-roy-mcgrath-wife-laura-bruner-family.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Who Is Roy Mcgrath Wife Laura Bruner?
